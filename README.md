"Shawna is very professional, organized and great to work with! Take initiative and delivers what she commits to doing." - Surbhi Grover (University of Pennsylvania Assistant Professor & Director of Global Radiation Oncology) 

"Shawna and I began working together during our last year at UC Irvine in 2020. We embarked on an end-to-end data-driven project, applied methods rooted in statistics and machine learning, and have continued working together since. Shawna is the ideal business partner because she is professional, accessible, flexible, and driven by her passion and desire to produce measurable, impactful results. Although she is easily able to teach and share from her own experience and industry knowledge, she is always aiming for growth in order to diversify her skill set. Without a doubt, Shawna is an asset to have for any business or tech pursuits." - Jessica George (Biostatistics Apprentice / Data Scientist at Allergan Aesthetics (an AbbVie company))

"Shawna was my mentor during my internship as part of a global oncology research team at the University of Pennsylvania. She was excellent in this role, consistently making herself available to help with any problems I encountered along the way. She led regular meetings in which she taught me and another intern the principles of data analysis and walked us through the analysis she was performing on our publication. Shawna also provided guidance when producing the manuscript for the publication. She assisted me through the outlining, drafting, and reviewing stages and provided very thoughtful feedback and recommendations." - Ganen Chinniah (University of Pennsylvania Neuroscience Undergraduate)

"I am honored to write a recommendation letter on behalf of Shawna Tuli. I got the opportunity to work with Shawna during the summer of 2021. She was my mentor and supervisor. Her great skills were remarkable as she had a huge contribution to my personal growth and she helped me achieve some of my academic goals. We worked together on writing a scientific paper about treatment delays for women with or without HIV co-infection in Botswana. Shawna oversaw my project and ensured that I was on the right track by editing my work, refining my writing skills and referring me to the appropriate resources whenever I needed further guidance. In addition to that, Shawna introduced me to the machine learning and statistical methods that were used to analyze the data from the Botswana cohort. When she noted that my interest was ignited, she went further and shared some of her coding projects so that I could enhance my knowledge. This ignited my passion for coding and I have further tried to merge my interest in coding and healthcare to align with my career goals. Shawna was also keen to ensure that I met my deadlines and helped me improve my time management skills by showing me how to organize my research, planning things ahead of time and using a calendar to set a system in place to schedule my day and use my time well. It was a great honor working with Shawna as she was not only a great mentor but she was very impactful to me." - Jane Muni (University of Pennsylvania Nursing Undergraduate)
